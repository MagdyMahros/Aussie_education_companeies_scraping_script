You may think that a blocked drain can be fixed with a plunger, or a crack in the piping with some sealant, but professional plumbers use tools that you might never have thought to have associated with their jobs. They use these to find and fix the root of the setback instead of the problems that they repeatedly cause, therefore saving you time, money and trouble in the long run.Your house is only your home if it is the way you want it. Growth of harmful fungi is never an appreciated addition to your home and it can be avoided with a simple call to a trust, professional plumber. There are many out there, so checking to make sure they have a proper license is essential, as is checking around to see if they have good testimonials from past customers. But once you find a professional plumber that you know can work well and effectively, offering your and your house a high standard of work, you will see the difference and know that it was the right choice.Faulty plumbing certainly isn't something an owner will want to face head on any day. Thus, they seek the help of professional plumbers without delay. Because various plumbing issues - clogged drains, sewer damages, leaky faucets, broken pipes, etc. - exist, the problem needs to be tended upon before it worsens.In case you are experiencing problems with plumbing at home or in the office, you have the option to fix the problem - that is if you know exactly what needs to be done. However, to ensure the best results, it is important to hire the services of a professional plumber hoppers crossing. Few modern households never realize how much they need the services of a reliable plumber until something goes wrong.Phone: 0425823111Email: Info@totalplumbingconcepts.com.auWebsite: http://totalplumbingconcepts.com.au/",null,null,null,null

It’s in our DNA to challenge the status quo and think differently about how our Clients’ challenges can be met. Thinking differently by looking at the challenge and working backwards to find solutions that are smarter, simpler and more intuitive. Our thinking differently about our Clients’ needs and challenges is engendered in our name. We challenge our Clients to think differently about us; starting with our unconventional name, our unorthodox spelling of ‘red’ and our refreshing and disruptive approach to the way we offer our services. THE STORYThe ‘Red(d) Zebra’ is based on a folklore told by African tribesman. It is said that the Red(d) Zebra will appear in times of need, when you are lost, and need direction to reach your goal. It is said that the Red(d) Zebra will lead you to the ‘truce of the water hole’ where everyone works collaboratively for the collective benefit of all. THE METAPHORThe African folklore (and beautiful metaphor) together with a drive to disrupt the current consulting experience, culminated in the inception of Redd Zebra; a collective of like-minded consultants who think differently and work collaboratively to provide a higher level of service that leads you to the achievement of your goal(s). Redd Zebra is driven to provide the expertise and results you expect but never truly experience.  THE WHATRedd Zebra provides Asset & Building Advisory services throughout the property (asset) continuum; from origination, acquisition and operation to re-positioning and disposal.
