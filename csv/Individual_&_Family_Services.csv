The Results Leadership Group designed the Results Scorecard a software tool, based on the principles of RBA, to help government and non-profit organisations maximise the framework’s potential. This includes creating the distinction between population and performance accountability, maintaining language discipline and promoting ends-to-means decision making.

HELLO MOJO App,"Australia, Australia, Australia 2001, AU","In July 2013, within a matter of hours, HELLO MOJO's founder, Annie Kendall went from living the happy, exciting & glamorous life of a Singapore expat to confronting the reality of divorce, no husband, saying goodbye to friends, moving countries, saying hello to lawyers & moving back in with her parents all the while nursing a newborn and running after a toddler.The first few weeks were debilitating but that was only the start of Annie's nightmare. Annie had left herself wide open to financial ruin, The Hague Convention Treaty (which she wasn't even aware of at the time), and with mounting legal bills she now relied on family and government assistance. What followed was 3-years of emotional, physical and financial stress, and hours of documenting everything - all the while feeling hopelessly vulnerable and afraid for what the future may hold. Annie was broken.The only thing Annie had at the time, was her 'love'​ for the children -- and a determination that no-one should ever be thrown into this negative, fear-driven legal space and required to spend more time documenting the details of their split for legal applications and the unknown, instead of attending to their children's needs, healing, co-parenting or learning to move forwards faster, in an empowered way. There was no solution. In 2016, Annie set out to build one. Soon, HELLO MOJO was born.HELLO MOJO gives people a private, highly secure, mobile-based app to streamline the daunting-but-vital admin and documenting process, to reduce stress levels, and save people's time, money and wellbeing.  But, the end of a relationship is more than just documentation: along with the perspiration, people need inspiration.

Smart Pups Assistance Dogs for Special Needs Kids,"PO Box 140, Pomona, Queensland 4568, AU","Smart Pups Assistance Dogs for Special Needs Children Inc.Smart Pups was the first organisation in Australia to be certified and recognised by the Guide Hearing and Assistance Dog Act 2009: to train task-specific Assistance Dogs for children under 18 years of age. After five years of lobbying, the Founder of Smart Pups finally had the Act amended so that children could have a trained Assistance Dog with an alternative handler. Our goal is to improve the quality of life of children living with autism or seizure related syndromes by training our Assistance Dogs in ‘task specific’ skills - providing safety, companionship, mobility and independence. Our vision is that every child in Australia living with autism, seizure, mobility and diabetes related syndromes will have access to the security and companionship of a Smart Pup Assistance Dog.Smart Pups Autism Assistance Dogs are specially trained to help children who have any disability falling within the Autism Spectrum. These dogs are trained to disrupt behaviour outside of the child's set behavourial pattern. In addition, Autism Assistance dogs can be trained to track the child should he or she wander away. Regardless of what advanced skills Autism Assistance Dogs might be trained to do, their primary purpose is to provide a best friend, confidant and playmate for a child who almost always has few friends.Smart Pups Seizure Alert Assistance Dogs are trained to respond when ‘their’ child is having a seizure, by alerting a parent or guardian adult. This alert response can signal a seizure up to 10 minutes before the seizure actually occurs. This amazing ability can detect seizures well before any existing medical technology.Since 2011, Smart Pups have placed over 90 highly-trained Assistance Dogs with families’ right across Australia – so we can now boast that Smart Pups is truly a national organisation. Although it costs around $28,000 to train each and every Smart Pup, the organisation does not receive any government funding, relying solely on contributions from the recipient family and the unselfish generosity of corporate and community support.",null,Indevidual and Family Services,11-50 employees,http://www.smartpups.org.au,"Pomona, Queensland",Nonprofit,2011,https://www.linkedin.com/company/smartpups/,"11 Emerald St, Cooroy QLD 4566, Australia",-26.4169864,152.9085967,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null

Happy Hubbub is a shared office space with high-speed wifi internet, printing/scanning facilities, networking opportunities and, crucially, an on-site short day care facility, allowing parents of preschoolers to work or study in the Hubbub with their children on-site but not under their feet, being looked after by qualified childcare professionals. 

With more small businesses today being started by women than men – often part-time at first whilst juggling child-rearing – a Hubbub membership will help relieve the pressures of fluctuating business demands, especially as many long daycare centres are unable to provide additional care on an ad-hoc basis or at short notice. 

The Hubbub is also a valuable tool for employers who embrace flexible working arrangements. Allowing employees coming back from parental leave to work remotely out of the Hubbub will ease the transition back to work, enabling parents to get on with their job in a professional setting yet stay close to their child, drop the commute to work and facilitate continued breastfeeding.

Bledisloe Group Holdings Pty Ltd,  (incorporating Bledisloe Australia Pty Ltd and Bledisloe New Zealand Pty Ltd) is an Australian owned private Company specifically formed in 2001 to purchase the Australian and New Zealand funeral operations owned by an American Corporation, 

 In 2005 the Company was partly acquired by private equity interests investing Australian superannuation funds.

Bledisloe Australia is the second largest owner and operator of funeral homes in Australia with funeral operations in Queensland, NSW, Tasmania and Victoria. In New Zealand, Bledisloe is the largest owner and operator.

Many of our funeral homes have been providing funeral services to families for decades, some for centuries. All of our business operations maintain and use their existing trading names to maintain the goodwill within the community that has been built up over many years. 

The name Bledisloe was chosen to reflect the fact that the company has funeral operations in both countries, and to reflect the values of community and civic responsibility that Lord Bledisloe promoted when he was Governor General of New Zealand in the early 1930’s, as we felt those values also reflected the role we play in the community.

Bledisloe Holdings assists approximately 11,000 families with their funeral arrangements annually in Australasia through over 300 dedicated staff in more than 50 mostly owned locations. Many of Bledisloe’s businesses have been serving local communities for over 100 years. In Queensland our main business is Metropolitan Funerals; in NSW, Gregory & Carr Boland Funerals; and in Victoria, W D Rose & Joseph Allison Funerals.

Susanne Nelson and Associates,"Eastern Suburbs, Melbourne, Victoria  AU","Susanne Nelson and Associates provides comprehensive and holistic therapy services to children and families with autism spectrum disorders. Susanne Nelson formed the practice as an Outreach provision in 2006, as she believes that therapy should be delivered in the environment where the child’s needs are the greatest.

SNAA provides an “Outreach Therapy Service” to your child either in your family home or your child’s Kindergarten or School setting.  Susanne Nelson formed this therapy service as an Outreach provision in 2006, as she believes that therapy should be delivered in the setting where the child’s needs are the greatest.

In her clinical experience, Susanne has found that therapy is most effective when “A teaching teacher model” is applied to the child’s parents, carers or educators in the appropriate setting.  This model ensures that your child not only learns the skills in the environment that is required, but also provides the carers/educators with the professional knowledge and strategies that can be carried over after each therapy session has been conducted.

At SNAA, the Therapists work very closely with you, your child and all team members within your child’s care.  In order to achieve this, we set up a “Student/ Parent Support Group email” system, whereby all team members (with your consent), can get access to our therapy progress notes after each therapy session has been conducted.  This is a way for all members to continually share knowledge and information about your child’s therapy program and coupled with the “teaching the teacher model”, contributes to your child’s ability to generalize the skills across all settings.

You choose the services you want. You choose when services are provided. You choose service providers that you know and like, or use trusted providers sourced and recommended by us.Cost - We charge a very small percentage of your package funds in fees. We charge much less than the industry average, and our charges are always crystal clear and up front - no hidden surprises. This leaves you with more money to spend on the services you want.Convenience - If you don't want the hassle of dealing with service providers, let us do the the work for you.

The capacity to experience spirituality is quantifiable and heritable.  The gene VMAT2 determines the capacity by altering monoamine levels.Over their lifetime, a person consciously or more likely subconsciously, subscribes to a mashup of values, principles, morals, ethics, beliefs and narratives, with or without affiliation to a particular religion or denomination.  Professional pastoral carers systemise values and principles; morals and ethics; beliefs including theology and narrative, to formalise your human spirit - manifested by your faith gene.Professional pastoral care is a manifestation process that methodically optimises human spirit capacity, quantified by the faith gene.

The Aboriginal people are fundamental to the Australian nation. They provide us with rich gifts of an ancient spiritual culture with links to the earth and country. Their power to survive is born out of a remarkable resilience through an interwoven sense of community that defies all efforts to destroy it. We know that a space to grow with a mother freed from anxiety is the best and most nurturing place for any child of any culture or race to develop and that secure attachment and bonding is the essential core from which later adult health is born.

In a spirit of empathic understanding and reconciliation, Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal professionals from Gunawirra, each supporting the other, work in companionship and harmony seeking a better and fuller life for Aboriginal and other marginalised peoples in Australia.

The primary role of Gunawirra is the design of unique, innovative and transformational programs.

Early childhood development requires caretakers to balance eagerness for pursuing adventure, creativity and self-expression with the development of responsibility. We aspire to set the standard in implementing modern understandings of child psychology in all our centres.

Happily Gifted,"367 Hawthorne Road, Hawthorne, Queensland 4171, AU","Every parent wants to see their child happy, but unfortunately that's not always the case. When your child is gifted, people often think that both you and your child are really lucky and that life must be easy raising this child. Gifted children do indeed have a lot of great qualities: they are passionate, quick thinkers, curious and like to take big steps towards a result instead of doing things in small steps, just to mention a few. 

Unfortunately, it isn't always as easy as it seems. Gifted children often feel like they don't fit in, they can be very unhappy at school and face a variety of other difficulties related to being gifted. 

Happily Gifted's goal is to offer a place where gifted children can be seen for what they really are: creative, bright, inquisitive, amazing! By meeting likeminded peers, reviving the desire to learn and working on difficulties like performance anxiety or a fixed mindset, gifted children can be helped to become happier people. 

Giving gifted children room for their own development, in school, at home and in society, creates beautiful opportunities for these children and the people around them. Happily Gifted creates an environment where they can fully develop emotionally and socially. From this base the children can enter relationships with other (gifted) children. This allows gifted children to develop into happy children who dare to use their skills at home, at school and in society. 

Happily Gifted also supports parents, teachers and other professionals who require help coaching gifted children. With Tessa's background in education, extensive theoretical knowledge about giftedness and broad experience in working with these children, Happily Gifted is able to offer tailored advice and assistance.

Some have never partnered or had children, which is more likely for women. We worry about our aging parents and are often have responsibility for their care and needs. A high proportion of us have experienced divorce, and we have some of the highest levels of debt. Ladies, we have the added pressure of perimenopausal hormonal changes.

Called “personal concierges,” goferGirl is a can do specialist, who’s reliable, discreet and can handle any assignment, from grocery shopping to gift buying, to standing in line for your all-time-favourite sporting and event tickets.

There has never been a better time for time-saving services in Perth. The mining boom in Western Australia has seen the time crisis reach new heights.  More and more people are opting to join the FIFO and offshore workers, lured by the lucrative pay packets, but as many will tell you its tough going and trying to get things done back home certainly at times can impose certain challenges.

Sharon Rosevear, owner, of goferGirl, recognized that every person’s time is precious, and decided to start a business that gives people back the gift of time in their busy lives.  “Why spend time waiting in line at the grocery store when you can be at the football, catching up with friends, taking your significant other out for dinner or just relaxing at home for a change?  Everyone could use a little more free time in their lives.”

goferGirl’s many clients agree that relief from time-consuming tasks like getting the car serviced, waiting for contractors to arrive, or buying gifts is a welcome service.

Signal Flare Inc,"PO Box 12507, George Street, QLD 4003, AU","Signal Flare is a charity that supports the homeless and other marginalized people by inviting the community to work together to providing free clothes, shoes, toiletries, children's toys, non perishable foods and more at their BBQs for the Homeless and Others in Need. Grant Richards or Grant the Polite Guy, as he is affectionately known by many, many people, was still homeless himself when he organised his first BBQ in 2011. He was touched to the core to see four hundred homeless people turn up to receive free food, clothes and toiletries. It inspired him to continue to organise these BBQs on a regular basis. In 2012 Berni Palings, nicknamed Bernie the Polite Girl by Grant, started to help. The BBQs grew, and with a dedicated team around them they founded this charity Signal Flare, which has helped hundreds of homeless and others in need since being established in 2013.At Signal Flare's BBQs, the volunteers find just as much joy and satisfaction at the guests, and the smiles are just as big. Berni Palings, the Director of Signal Flare has been there from the beginning. ‘Our main goals are to help people with a second chance in life, and to promote equality and social inclusion, giving food and basic necessities for free in a very social environment to those who cannot afford them. When we come across those who want to get back on their feet, we like to empower them to turn their lives around.  Our most important mission, however, is to restore self-belief, self-worth and dignity for people who hit hard times. Grant always says, “when you see homeless people and you take out the word “homeless “, all you see is people”. And that is so true. We are all people no matter what our circumstances, so let’s treat each other as such’.

Orana UnitingCare in Meadow Heights, a community service agency of the Uniting Church,

The Uniting Church established the Hotham Mission Asylum Seeker Project (ASP) in 1997 to
help asylum seekers who faced destitution while living lawfully in the community and awaiting an
outcome on their refugee claim. In 2013 the ASP was transferred to Lentara UnitingCare.

At Lentara UnitingCare we:
- affirm cultural diversity
- show compassion for the vulnerable
- encourage people to value and use their strengths
- advocate on behalf of those who are disadvantaged
