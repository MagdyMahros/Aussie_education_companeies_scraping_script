IOT Data Centres,"Ellengowan Dr, Brinkin, Northern Territory 0810, AU","IOTDC is a DataCentre Project Developer.   Its core business is the development of a footprint of community integrated facilities that together form what we refer to as a ‘mesh hyperscale data centre’.    In order to do this, we build data centre facilities in sustainable regions where typically local demand is starved of enterprise capability due to physical distance from existing data centre services.   We call this problem “capital city syndrome”.    I.e. in Australia this is closely equated to locations or ‘medium’ population hubs that are at a distance from the major capital cities of Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth (where there is plenty of data centre capacity).   We have also progressed plans to develop  in SE Asia including India and Nepal.In our mesh, each node may be a hyperscale facility in its own right, but it only evolves into that mature state based on the demand at that geographical location.   We offset development investment risk by only building capacity in a modular fashion when it is needed and by using a Turnkey solution.  This is a proven business model in other parts of the world. Whilst our core offering is data centre services, as our solution is a community integrated offering, what exists inside the facility is also extended to the rest of the community where we offer both IOT solutions, Smart City Ring Infrastructure/Canopies and Backhaul connectivity.   ie we build beyond our four walls.  Where we can, what platforms we adopt in our facility, we offer to the wider community in a transactional consumption model allowing business that normally can’t afford the latest technology to consume as and when they may see the opportunity to differentiate.  We also seek to consume locally offered community services in preference to building or developing our own (As an example we do not build board rooms into the facility and generally push that to commercial buildings nearby).

In July 2000, ACN decided to become a telecommunications company and introduced its very own long distance service: ACN Long Distance. This service set the standard for outstanding long distance service in North America and Canada.

Three years later, on the dawn of its 10-year anniversary, ACN exploded onto the local calling scene, providing customers with the freedom to choose their local phone service provider. Globally, ACN now offers a wide range of telecommunications and essential services including Home & Business Phone, Mobile, Broadband Internet, Digital Phone Services and video phones, Energy, Home Security and Satellite TV.

Its inception is another important milestone in China Telecom’s decade of overseas expansion in the Asia-Pacific region. Subsequent to the deployment of the nodes in Hong Kong, Singapore and Japan, the completion of the Australian network node marks China Telecom’s preliminary accomplishment of its network layout of four core nodes in the Asia-Pacific region. These nodes will help China Telecom further extend the reach of its global services and network. Also, as our business continues to expand, branches will be set up in Melbourne, Perth and Brisbane successively apart from CTAU’s headquarters in Sydney.

This move signals the Company’s intention to strengthen cooperation and explore business opportunities with major telecom operators on the basis of “drawing upon each other’s strengths, and win-win cooperation”, to cooperate with business partners for service quality improvement and joint value creation in the Asia-Pacific region, and to provide a one-stop international communication service including local support for Chinese-funded transnational businesses.
