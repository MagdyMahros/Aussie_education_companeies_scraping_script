At ACTE, we believe in helping students achieve more than they ever thought possible and are focused on proving every student with the support and tools they need to be successful.

VA Institute of Australia,"Sydney, NSW  AU","Without fail, every VA has a story to tell about their journey from their employee role to becoming a VA, and it always includes a ‘catalyst’ for them to make the move from an employee to their own virtual business. 
 
For some people, the catalyst was because they have young kids and want to be there for them; or others might be fed up with commuting hours each day; or perhaps they’ve been made redundant and just don’t feel like going back to a full-time work; and some people live remotely and find job roles are hard to come by.
 
We should rejoice in these stories because they’re the very fabric of our diverse and wonderful industry.  We come from all walks of life, and we bring our own unique skills and talents with us.
 
The physical act of making the move is also different and unique for everyone.  Some people start gradually by dipping their ‘toe’ in the water to get a feel for it, some plan their start extremely meticulously, whilst some throw themselves in at the deep end and either sink or swim (not recommended!).

Moving from your employee based role to your new self-employed Virtual business in a way that sets you up for success requires a lot of thought and forward planning. 

The VA Institute is your go-to resource for education and training, and hands-on, practical support to support you in this exciting stage of your career / business life.

-	How do you attract students to courses
-	How do you motivate disengaged students
-	How do you develop employability skills in students to achieve great emplloyment outcomes.

Formula Student® - Australia RTO 41124,"Mt Gravatt Tafe Campus, 1030 Cavendish Rd, Mt Gravatt East, Qld 4122, AU","Formula Student is a training organisation whose philosophy is designed around the student, not the teacher.

With student-centric classes we are different from other training organisations whose philosphy revolves around teacher-centric programs. Our classes are based on learning while the others are based on teaching.

With this student-centric philosophy as the centrepiece of learning at Formula Student, we believe the student needs to have ownership in their progress and a clear understanding of not just how to do a task but why. On top of this, the learning needs to be relevant and/or useful. I know I don't like making token items that mean nothing and end up in the bin at the end of the class so why would others be inspired by this out-dated and irrelevant method of learning.

We use motorsport as a base for our learning. Students develop a paradigm of what the end result is early in the course and from there we create a learning pathway for the student to follow to achieve the outcomes expected.

While we use motorsport as a base, the course ISN'T ABOUT motorsport. What it IS ABOUT is engineering pathways. It's about skills and knowledge development. It's about developing a familiarity with the engineering discourse, from the language used, to the processes and methods. It's about students building an understanding of jobcards and two way communication. It's about building an understanding of quality assurance and how this is achieved. It's about learning through project work. It's about being a member of a team. It's about communicating with others in an informative and accurate way.
