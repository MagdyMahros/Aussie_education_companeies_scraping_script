Mortgage Broker or Sirius Finance Professional?

Mortgage Brokers are commonly known to be of great assistance to many many people seeking finance for their homes and investments. However the term broker does not fully encompass our role in meeting your finance needs. A broker is defined as an intermediary within a transaction. Once the transaction is complete it is forever done. This does not truly represent the relationship that a Sirius Finance Professional extends beyond the transaction.

In our role as a Sirius Finance Professional I take a long term view of our relationships. Available to answer questions to help you make sound decisions in finance. Whether you have been a client for 5 minutes or 5 years, we will always take an interest in your finance needs. Making your financial future brighter.

McQueen Group,"Level 21, 357 Collins Street, Melbourne, Victoria 3000, AU","McQueen Group develops and implements financially focussed strategies and solutions, particularly tailored to “private clients”, executives, professionals and entrepreneurs.
 
We are aware that the concept of “private clients” gets thrown around regularly in the finance and consulting industries.  But we have developed a truly leading edge consultancy practice that we think will dramatically help our clients and their families evolve financially.
 
We provide a suite of leading edge strategies and solutions across multiple intertwined financial disciplines – structure, taxation, investment, cash flow, superannuation, insurances, estate planning, lending and related elements – to activate a coherent strategy that will deliver meaningful long term after tax financial results.  Our approach is different to the “old world”.  It is proactive, cross skilled and delivered.
 
To use an analogy of an orchestra – you can have individually talented musicians each playing their own piece of music, but unless they are all well-rehearsed and are all playing the same piece of music at the same time, the outcomes for the audience are unlikely to sound as intended.  We act as the conductor and all or some of the parts as required.  Our expert, well-rehearsed and co-ordinated skills will play beautiful music that you will enjoy.  Simply, we believe the McQueen team will deliver far greater value to your financial outcomes than individual practitioners who are each playing their own tune.
 
Our favourite expression is “challenge the accepted”.  It underpins our thinking and our actions.  It is a value that enshrines our approach to each client and their circumstances and desired outcomes. We never rest on our laurels.  We never assume that near enough is good enough.  We never accept that we have completed the race.  Circumstances change.  Laws change.  Outcomes and objectives change.

Our purpose is to help achieve the best retirement outcomes for members of super funds through the development of good public policy and industry best practice. ASFA has been operating since 1962.

•Not for profit: We re-invest our income back into the industry and community via research and advocacy projects based on the expertise of our experienced policy and Research Centre teams. This includes producing submissions to the government, reports, best practice papers, education for the community and research into key issues affecting superannuation fund members.

•Non-sector aligned: ASFA focuses on whole-of-system issues including superannuation system design, regulatory frameworks, industry operations and governance. We take positions that are in the best interest of fund members, rather than advocating any one sector’s interests over another.

•Non-party political: We advocate for sound, long-term public policy, not politically aligned outcomes.
 
Through our members – which include superannuation funds from the corporate, industry, retail and public sectors, as well as service providers – we represent the whole super industry.

We appreciate how important it is for companies with R&D to have the right mix of capital and cash flow when starting out, because we’ve been there ourselves. At Radium, financing R&D tax advances is all we do. We’re experts in helping you reinvest your own money sooner because we’re passionate about helping businesses of all sizes grow. Our platform-based approach enables us to deliver confident service and outstanding results using technology that reduces costs and makes time for people. We don’t think like a bank, so we see security differently and can help more businesses access their money faster. The only security businesses typically need to apply for a Radium Advance is their R&D refund. This means as owners and investors, you hold onto more of the equity you’re working so hard to create.  We also improve cash flow by advancing your R&D tax refund quarterly. A Radium Advance can be an individual burst of cash flow, but it works best when you use it strategically under our Radium Quarterly Advance model.  The more you use Radium Advances, the more your R&D benefits. Radium Quarterly Advances make R&D dollars go further than annual advances. By choosing quarterly advances, you can either spend up to 50% more on R&D using the same expenditure, or reduce your capital outlay by up to 33%.

Slyp was born out of the frustration that traditional paper receipts are painfully inconvenient for customers, a missed opportunity for retailers, and bad for the environment. Today, we seamlessly tap our cards, our phones, even our watches to make a payment, but at the end of a transaction, we’re still handed a centuries-old paper receipt that will likely end up in the bin. We thought there must be a better way.   Slyp’s mission is to turn the end of a transaction into the beginning of a customer relationship. By re-imagining receipts, we’ve unlocked their missed potential and made them fit them into today's smart, eco-conscious world.  By linking receipts to cards, Slyp’s solution offers game-changing opportunities for retailers and banks. Retailers gain insights on in-store shoppers and can engage customers post-purchase through each Slyp receipt. Banks capture item-level purchase data, which can be used to enhance their digital proposition and improve operational efficiency.
