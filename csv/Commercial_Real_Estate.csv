Total Plumbing Concepts,"35 Waters dr Seaholme, 2/21Gervis dr, Werribee, Victoria 3030, AU","The best in the west no job to small , On time everytime , highly skilled in all areas.Residential and light commercial contractors , highly skilled in drainage camera services and jetting work as well as hot water and gas fitting .A professional plumber Werribee is trained and experienced in what they do, knowing exactly how to fix plumbing problems with the least work and damage needed. You may think that a blocked drain can be fixed with a plunger, or a crack in the piping with some sealant, but professional plumbers use tools that you might never have thought to have associated with their jobs. They use these to find and fix the root of the setback instead of the problems that they repeatedly cause, therefore saving you time, money and trouble in the long run.Your house is only your home if it is the way you want it. Growth of harmful fungi is never an appreciated addition to your home and it can be avoided with a simple call to a trust, professional plumber. There are many out there, so checking to make sure they have a proper license is essential, as is checking around to see if they have good testimonials from past customers. But once you find a professional plumber that you know can work well and effectively, offering your and your house a high standard of work, you will see the difference and know that it was the right choice.Faulty plumbing certainly isn't something an owner will want to face head on any day. Thus, they seek the help of professional plumbers without delay. Because various plumbing issues - clogged drains, sewer damages, leaky faucets, broken pipes, etc. - exist, the problem needs to be tended upon before it worsens.In case you are experiencing problems with plumbing at home or in the office, you have the option to fix the problem - that is if you know exactly what needs to be done. However, to ensure the best results, it is important to hire the services of a professional plumber hoppers crossing.

From the Harbour to the beaches and the bays, the Eastern Suburbs has a unique energy, a lifestyle envied by many and enjoyed by few.

In the unique Eastern Suburbs property market, experience is conclusive. It is even more crucial with commercial property. Quite simply, there is no substitute for local knowledge. It makes all the difference. That is what makes Ray White Commercial Eastern Suburbs (RWCES) the right choice. 

For a fresh, young company, there is a rich vein of experience running through the business. RWCES offers priceless, specialist knowledge second to none.  RWCES has evolved from the highly successful Ray White Double Bay Commercial division which was established by Grant Whiteman in 1989. In 2002, Grant decided to build on this platform of experience and form Ray White Commercial Eastern Suburbs in a joint venture with Ray White Double Bay.

RWCES provides a complete range of specialist commercial property services in Sydney's Eastern Suburbs.

Did you know that unused desk at the back of your office could add $22,400 per annum to your bottom line? Real Commercial listings are changing.

The Underground Campus is a website for listing Real Commercial properties. Businesses want to share space or assets which would otherwise go unused. While other real commercial websites might focus on co-working, desk share or office share, The Underground Campus covers the full spectrum of business sharing needs ranging from popular listing categories such as Offices, Retail, Industrial and Parking to more niche categories such as Massage Clinics, Medical, Consulting, Gyms, Showrooms for Bulky Goods & even Rural properties.

Reddzebra,null,"THINK DIFFERENTLYRedd Zebra challenges itself and our Clients to think differently. It’s in our DNA to challenge the status quo and think differently about how our Clients’ challenges can be met. Thinking differently by looking at the challenge and working backwards to find solutions that are smarter, simpler and more intuitive. Our thinking differently about our Clients’ needs and challenges is engendered in our name. We challenge our Clients to think differently about us; starting with our unconventional name, our unorthodox spelling of ‘red’ and our refreshing and disruptive approach to the way we offer our services. THE STORYThe ‘Red(d) Zebra’ is based on a folklore told by African tribesman. It is said that the Red(d) Zebra will appear in times of need, when you are lost, and need direction to reach your goal. It is said that the Red(d) Zebra will lead you to the ‘truce of the water hole’ where everyone works collaboratively for the collective benefit of all. THE METAPHORThe African folklore (and beautiful metaphor) together with a drive to disrupt the current consulting experience, culminated in the inception of Redd Zebra; a collective of like-minded consultants who think differently and work collaboratively to provide a higher level of service that leads you to the achievement of your goal(s). Redd Zebra is driven to provide the expertise and results you expect but never truly experience.  THE WHATRedd Zebra provides Asset & Building Advisory services throughout the property (asset) continuum; from origination, acquisition and operation to re-positioning and disposal.  We work with you to minimise and mitigate risk, reduce unnecessary costs and optimise returns.WHY REDD ZEBRA?It is said that people engage on the Why not the What of a business. Our Why is enabling you to achieve your project goals.  Our success is measured in its attainment.
