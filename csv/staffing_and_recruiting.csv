Supply Jobs Australia,"Perth,   AU","As a procurement professional I found myself frustrated with the current job boards available.

Searching resulted in a handful of supply chain related role and a lot of 'general results'. Alternatively I could insert my keywords and use a number of tricky drop downs before searching to refine my search.

If I wanted to narrow my search down to particular companies, the search became even more troublesome. I also couldn’t guarantee that all the supply chain roles were listed in the category I'd selected as the company advertising for a procurement role might be advertising in banking!

I could set up job alerts but I then found myself missing out on new job postings because what I would consider a “contracts specialist” might be called a contract engineer or contracts advisor somewhere else. If I wanted to be more vague my inbox was being bombarded with random ‘specialist’ roles that had nothing to do with procurement whatsoever.

What I needed was a job board that specialised in supply chain jobs and nothing else. I needed a job board that I could quickly browse without having to try a thousand different search terms. I needed a job board that would show me every supply chain role currently listed in a major city just by selecting the name of that city. I needed a job board that would show me a list of companies advertising supply chain roles so I could just click on the name of the company that interested me to list all the procurement jobs currently being advertised by that company.

Unfortunately this job board didn’t exist so like any tenacious supply chain person, I went about building my own!

The result is supplyjobs.com.au. We are now the largest job board for supply chain professionals within Australia. We are passionate about making our website the most user friendly resource for supply chain professionals available and hope to make your job searching experience a more user friendly and pleasurable one.

Our recruitment philosophy is simple, “no surprises” and “transparency in delivery” – this means that at all times we will keep you informed as to how we operate, why we operate in a particular way and what to expect when dealing with us.

We are a unique blend of a large company that supplies personal service. You’ll find our response to your staffing issues refreshing in the speed and professionalism with which we operate.

Symmetry currently has five offices, all located in Sydney and Melbourne. We also can also service clients in Brisbane, Adelaide and Perth as required and we are working toward establishing our aim of fourteen operational offices around Australia.

The Network Technology Recruitment,null,"Technology is changing all the time, requiring new skills and sharper expertise. But there is one constant – the key to bringing the best talent and the best companies together is understanding people. 

We move beyond 'what do you need'​ to 'why do you need it'​; discovering the qualities and experience that will help leading businesses to achieve and surpass their goals.

At The Network we go deeper than other recruiters, taking the time to consult with every client. We ask questions and explore issues until we clearly understand your needs. We don't match key words in a resumé or send out volumes of mismatched CVs. Instead we work on establishing which companies and which roles best suit our global network of highly sought-after technologists. At The Network we believe this is the only way to achieve quality driven recruitment results.

We support our clients with specific business or growth challenges. You may need to establish a new division quickly and require help in defining roles and identifying the skills that will deliver the results you need. You may have problems to solve or a competitive edge to deliver. With a detailed understanding of your needs and a big-picture external perspective, we can help define the less obvious characteristics of your next great hire.
We're always available for information, guidance and help on sourcing and retaining highly qualified technology professionals.
