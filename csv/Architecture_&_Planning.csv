BOLD was founded in 2007 by Stewart and Suellen Bagley and have since worked on a large number and diverse range of projects varying in type and scale.

The name BOLD was inspired by Stewart & Suellen's passion to produce distinct and exemplary architecture appropriate to purpose and place. It was also inspired by a quote by the late Architect, Samuel Mockbee who would challenge his graduating students with the phrase '..proceed and be bold'

The practice currently consists of a team of four which draws on over 40 years of combined experience obtained from many regions of Australia, the UK and Ireland. BOLD strive to not only create an end product that 'works' but more importantly create an experiential building that possesses 'soul'.

For a building to 'work' BOLD believes that each project must have efficient planning that facilitates it's use and enhances it. The design should respond to and control it's climatic conditions and possess sound environmentally, sustainable design principles. However, BOLD also believe that the building and buildings that encapsulate us and surround us must do more than just facilitate use. Buildings can evoke feelings, enhance a sense of place, energise a space and heighten or challenge our senses.

We add further value to this process through independent research. We look for better solutions, and a number of patent applications for building technologies are testament to this commitment. We also engage in debate in seeking new solutions to both emerging and existing building programs.  

Our design solutions are driven by the specifics of the brief, not a predetermined design style. We seek to create structures that fit with their environment, are functional, carefully crafted and aesthetically pleasing.

Invention excites us. We address the needs of our clients, building users and the community by identifying the specific needs of each project. We ask the right questions without imposing pre-determined solutions and then we use our 6Ds process to take us to the invention stage. This process has opened people’s eyes to impossible realities.

The outcome is sensory – architecture that people can feel, not just see. Architecture that makes people think, acknowledging the origins of architecture and its plethora of influences, both ancient and modern.
 
We are conscious of the impact our buildings have on the city, its inhabitants and the environment. This awareness informs our work – we take pride in the end results but consider the effects and requirements of our projects beyond their completion, well into the future. We practice environmental design based on a first principles approach, inspired by the natural environment.

carabiner,"572 Hay St, Perth, Western Australia 6000, AU","No two buildings are ever the same. Every public building we have created – from sport and art centres to clinics and museums – is designed for its own purpose. And we believe it’s to serve the people who use them every day, each on their own unique path.At the heart of it, we don’t design empty buildings. Our buildings teem with life – messy, exciting, creative, human life.We also think there’s something to be said for an architect with genuine interest and understanding of a building’s purpose, and who designs it accordingly. No grandeur-driven agenda. Just good, thorough design that will last.Just think about all the time you spend in and around buildings. Of course, you’re probably sitting in one right now. You might not immediately notice a great one, but if it’s bad, you’ll know it. Spend enough time there and it’ll start to affect not only what you do, but how you feel. So, for us, designing one poorly is simply not an option. In fact, that goes for most things we do. It’s just not in our nature.And that’s just what we’ve been doing for over 20 years. Designing good public buildings – from hospitals, schools, community and sport centres, to police stations, courthouses, and even airports. All our works are unique, responding to their sites, communities, cultures, and aspirations.We don’t take our responsibility lightly. Public buildings are funded by all of us and will be used by many people. The impact of our design decisions will affect people we have never met before, and for many years to come. We also consider ecological, economic, and social sustainability in every design.And over all else, we’re guides, not gurus. We’re not out to conquer the great peaks of life alone.

UDLA,"Level 1A, 3-5 Josephson Street, Fremantle, Western Australia 6160, AU","UDLA is a multi-award winning studio specialising in Landscape Architecture, Urban Design, & Community Development.

To us, it is the result of an inclusive process that involves all of the people it seeks to engage in equal measure, whether they are end users, contributing professional participants, or stakeholders.  It is a progression through history, environment, population and practice, encompassing commercial, social, behavioural and aesthetic goals.

This approach hinges on the understanding that people and place need to be connected. Therefore the health of a community has an intrinsic relationship with how empowered participants are engaged with their environment, or have a say in changing their existing condition into a preferred one. This ‘people first’ approach makes UDLA unique amongst design studios in WA and a leader in contemporary design thinking.

Our work begins by listening in order to identify the requirements and uniqueness of the multiple user groups likely to inhabit a place, and envisioning a spatial outcome that works for all of them by collaborating, sharing ideas and generating collective creativity. Our role goes beyond that of traditional landscape architects; we see ourselves as facilitators, designers, coordinators, communicators and, at times, mentors. Our inclusive approach, and the agreement that stems from it, allows us to proceed with the detailed design work – the documentation and realisation of all those ideas – with confidence and originality.

Healthy and active lifestyles can be encouraged by the way we design our streets, parks, recreational facilities and where we locate our homes, schools and retail areas. To address this, the Heart Foundation has collaborated with planning, transport and local government groups across Australia to develop Healthy Active by Design (HAbD), an online tool kit.The online tool provides the best available evidence, practical advice, resources and local case studies which have been categorised into eight design features. These design features have been identified as crucial ones that support healthy and active living: Public Open Space; Community Facilities; Buildings; Destinations; Movement Networks; Housing Diversity; Sense of Place and Healthy Food. Each design feature provides a useful summary of the best evidence available to help demonstrate its importance in supporting active living.  The online tool also includes a Master Checklist for each design feature, which has been prepared focusing on the Planning Framework. The checklist provides a list of strategies and questions that town planners, developers and designers can ask themselves when creating, preparing and assessing new developments to help evaluate the impact of the proposal on health and wellbeing. Other potential users of the guide include professionals from community development, health, sport and recreation, who can use the tool to evaluate the impact of the projects on health and physical activity.

RMIT Architecture,"154 Victoria St, Melbourne, Victoria  AU","RMIT Architecture & Urban Design is an architecture school based in Melbourne, Australia.  We are interested in ideas-led, venturous design experimentation and exploration that aspires to contribute to the future of the discipline and an increasingly complex world. The school is primarily focused on design with an international reputation for design excellence. We focus on research through design practice which is at the centre of our activities. The RMIT Architecture program sees architectural design as a tool for speculating on new ideas about the built environment. The term venturous practice is a summation of its objectives; characterised by the nexus between the experimental or speculative, and the realisable in practice. Its intent is on nurturing a relationship between these two that is both symbiotic and critical; that promotes a culture of practice-based learning, teaching and research. This program aims to engage strongly with architectural practice and with a culture of differentiation within the spectrum of practice.

In each project, Wood Marsh’s founding principles are evident: the sculptural quality of the external forms, the play of solidity and transparency, and the materiality of the limited palettes. Each reminds us that contemporary architecture can have a permanence, and that practical design can be unique and beautiful.

Unmoved by the ebb and flow of design trends, Roger Wood and Randal Marsh cite the arts, generally, rather than architecture specifically, as being of a greater influence on their practice and are proud that their work has been acquired by the National Gallery of Victoria, the National Gallery of Australia, RMIT University and private collectors.
