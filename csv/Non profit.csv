Cambodia has a heart breaking recent history which has crippled this beautiful south east Asian country. During the 1960s and '70s, while civil war raged in Cambodia, the USA carpet bombed the Cambodian countryside. The communists won the civil war and over the next four years, more than a quarter of the population was systematically murdered by its leader, Pol Pot. More than thirty years later, the disastrous impact on the gentle-natured people of Cambodia is still profound.

Sunrise Cambodia began in the early 1990s when a South Australian fifty-year old named Geraldine Cox took in a group of orphans she found fending for themselves near the Thai border. These were some of the orphaned grandchildren from Pol Pot's murderous regime. Unable to have her own children, Geraldine became ‚ÄúMum to Many‚Äù as she took in street kids, orphans and the disabled to give them good food, a place to sleep, an education and lots of love.

With the need so great, Sunrise Cambodia has grown to support whole communities with much-needed sustainable development so that families can thrive: clean water, sanitation and healthcare, followed by education. Sunrise has a team of 100 Cambodian staff and a small fundraising crew in Australia.

We do this through live crowdfunding events where like-minded individuals, foundations and corporations come together to create powerful social change. At each event, three or four social entrepreneurs running grassroots charities, non-profits or early-stage social enterprises pitch for funding. In six-minute segments these presenters share their inspiring stories and invite guests to become part of innovative solutions to community issues.

Guests are given time to ask questions and pledge support. Donations start from as little as $100 per person, with the collective goal to raise at least $10,000 for each pitching organisation. Donors are encouraged to give more than funding and follow-up with mentoring, skilled services and in-kind resources to support the causes they feel passionately about.

Our engaging, interactive and inclusive events unite people to achieve more as a group than individually. By empowering people to give, we challenge the notion that only the wealthy can make a difference. We expand and deepen the practice of giving and capacity-building by making it collaborative, rewarding and accessible to all.

Employment opportunities for women in the industry have expanded to include roles such as customer service representatives, field technicians, marketing managers, leaders and senior managers. Professional Women in Australian Pest Management (PWAPM) is an association that aims to represent professional women in our industry. PWAPM creates opportunities for women to connect and engage both online and face to face, through an active Facebook group and website, and through social events and professional workshops. At an industry level, PWAPM acts as the ‚Äòvoice' of women in pest management. We see our industry entering a period of significant technical advancement and achieving higher levels of professionalism than ever before. The bar is continually being raised by our female industry leaders. The aim of PWAPM is to offer women an effective way to meet valuable contacts and share ideas, while also providing a space for gender equality to be discussed without judgement. Pest control is a customer-driven industry that is dependent on communication and relationships ‚Äì two areas where women tend to excel. It can also be a fast-paced business where it's essential to wear many hats at once. Let's be honest, most women are serious multitaskers! We are also problem-solvers who tend to think differently to men ‚Äì and variety in thinking is advantageous. (It's perhaps no surprise that many successful pest control operations are husband and wife teams!) PWAPM serves to empower women in our industry, so that we can all work together ‚Äì both men and women ‚Äì to better serve our customers. It is fantastic to see men in the industry are embracing our unique female strengths.By coming together, women in pest management can help support, grow and cultivate this industry, which is to the benefit of everyone.",2018

In a nutshell, we run food education projects for young people.

Beyond the nutshell, we're a national volunteer-led organisation that aims to build the skills, knowledge and experience that young people have around food. More than that, we empower them to take those skills, knowledge and experiences out into the world and create the food system that they believe in.

Why?

It's important. Food can often feel like an epic minefield. With everyone from bloggers, scientists, farmers, celebrity chefs, dietary guidelines, friends and your Instagram feed clambering for a say in what goes on your dinner plate, young people are dealing with more mixed messages than autocorrect fail text exchanges with your mum.

But ultimately, knowing where your food comes from matters. Here's why:

// We're getting fatter
// Our farmers are getting older
// We're losing food skills, fast
// We're wasting huge amounts of the food we grow, and
// We're further away from where our food grows than we've ever been.

By building a generation of young Australians who can cook, who can read a label, who understand the challenges facing farmers, who know the basics of how food grows and how it reaches our plate, we also build a generation of people that are healthier, more connected to our food and land, and better able to support farmers without it costing us the earth.

That's where we come in.

YFM exists to help fill in the gaps. We provide a place ‚Äì be that in pubs, in living rooms, on laptop screens ‚Äì for information and skills to be exchanged and for learning to happen. We don't believe in telling people what to do, we believe that by young people knowing and sharing more about where our food comes from (how it was grown, who grew it, what can even be done with it ), they become armed with the skills, knowledge and experience to build us a sweet food future.

These skills, knowledge and experience, collectively, we like to call ‚Äòfood literacy'.",2011

With a name like ASIAA (Asian Students in Australia Association), the common attribution with the society's exclusiveness is inevitable.  But ASIAA is far from that. Founded in 2012, ASIAA was established to be a melting pot of cultures, drawing in students who want to embrace the Asian culture, regardless of their backgrounds. Members of the society can range from Asian international students who simply miss the comforting cuisines and friends from home, to students with no Asian heritage whatsoever, but want to hit if off on the dance-floor with people just as crazy as them about Big Bang's new release. There are countless societies on campus, but come to any of ASIAA's events, and you'll see exactly why we stand out. With a fusion of both worlds where East meets West, we present monthly POPASIAA Nights held at the Mooseheads Nightclub, where top KPOP (Korean Pop) hits are remixed with thumping electrical Western influences.

Since 1990, AGA has run a National Crisis Line which is utilized equally as much for pregnancy crisis as abortion grief. A fifth of the crisis calls are from men. Further, a significant number of callers are from health professionals, unable to access information on abortion trauma through their own peer sources. From its inception, AGA has focused on professional development. Evaluations from presentations across Australia, at public/private hospitals, community health and welfare centres, universities and to professional non-health associations, consistently indicate our work is most welcomed by those with direct patient contact.Building on our ongoing consultation within the health care community, AGA has assisted prominent health professionals and community service organizations to develop their expertise in the field of abortion trauma. However, without community support the effectiveness of early intervention and therapy programs will be limited. Through developing diverse partnerships and initiatives, AGA is working to promote community awareness of the needs of those traumatized by abortion and of pregnant women and their families in difficult social circumstances.

When union delegates gathered in the Victorian Trades Hall in 1927 to establish the Australian Council of Trade Unions they had a clear vision - to lift the living standards and quality of working life of working people.

And their strategy to achieve this was also clear ‚Äì to build union organisation of the workforce on a national basis.

Ninety years on, the ACTU, its affiliated unions and their members celebrate a proud record of achievement on behalf of working Australians and the community.

The industrial gains are many: decades of wage increases through the award system and campaigns in the field, safer workplaces, equality for women, improvements in working hours, entitlements to paid holidays and better employment conditions, and the establishment of a universal superannuation system.

The ACTU has played a role in all of these achievements, but has contributed to fairness and justice in the community as well ‚Äì contributing to Australia's post-war development and immigration program, the social security system, Medicare and education - to name just a few areas of policy.

The ACTU has also represented Australian unionism in the international arena, opposing discrimination and oppression and supporting human rights. The ACTU aid agency, APHEDA ‚Äì Union Aid Abroad, contributes to humanitarian projects in many countries.

The enduring commitment of working Australians to a fairer society is reflected in the continuing fight to protect the fundamental principles of unionism.

The right to organise and the right to collectively bargain sit at the heart of the 21st century struggle for a just Australia, just as it did throughout the previous century.

We will best keep the faith with those who have worked and sacrificed to build the ACTU over the past eight decades  by keeping the union cause bright and vibrant into the future.",1927

Hip dysplasia is the most common birth defect globally, with 1 in 100 infants requiring treatment, and it is the most common cause of hip arthritis in adults. Despite this awareness for the condition, and practical support for those impacted by it, remains limited. Only 57% of the 1000 respondents to our 2018 survey, had heard of the condition prior to diagnosis. Rates of late diagnosed hip dysplasia are also increasing in Australia (Increase in late diagnosed developmental dysplasia of the hip in South Australia: risk factors, proposed solutions. Med J Aust 2016: 204 (6): 240.) Late diagnosis is considered a significant public health issue. Why:‚Ä¢ Lower likelihood of success of conservative treatment methods,‚Ä¢ Higher rates of surgery,‚Ä¢ Increased complications (such as avascular necrosis)‚Ä¢ And increased health care costs.Late diagnosis is also associated with time away from school/study/work, restrictions on play and leisure pursuits, and the increased likelihood of pain for the individual. Whilst not life threatening, this condition can be life changing both for the individual and their family, therefore awareness for it, and how to facilitate hip health, is vital to benefit people across the lifespan. Practical support to minimise the impact of the condition on a person's quality of life, and activities of daily living is also needed.¬†We can't eliminate hip dysplasia but together we can support more people impacted by it, and increase the reach of our awareness initiatives. Early diagnosis is key. Since 2015, Healthy Hips Australia has been passionate in developing and providing vital support and resources to increase awareness for the condition.",2015
