It provides a simple framework, tools, guidance, and resources for businesses to get the most out of digital technologies that lead to lasting innovation and success. Digital Transformation is the single most important opportunity that enables organizations to leverage technologies across all aspects of the business. Done properly, businesses reap the benefits of more informed decision making, improved processes, and better communication. All resulting in exceptional client experience and improved bottom line. When done ad-hoc, businesses risk employees becoming less productive, processes breaking down and clients getting frustrated - potentially leading to customers and employees looking toward the competition. In the past, savvy executives looked for new growth opportunities then implemented technologies, such as a CRM to boost sales, line of business applications to get more visibility into the business, or team collaboration tools to improve internal communication. However, these initiatives did not always go as anticipated. Some failed entirely, others delivered less than desired results, and many just went way over budget. The reason failure has been so common is twofold. First, internal IT personnel and outsourced IT providers do not understand the business and tend to focus solely on the technology. Then they often fail to provide a systematic approach for executives to uncover opportunities, plan initiatives, and successfully execute projects. Keeping up with change and staying ahead of the curve requires businesses to employ a systematic approach to ensure Digital Transformation initiatives are well planned, flawlessly executed, and rapidly adopted across the organization.",null,IT and Services,11-50 employees,http://www.digitalmaturitygroup.com,null,Privately Held,null,https://www.linkedin.com/company/digital-maturity-group/,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null

With this as the goal, Retarus steers the flow of information for major companies throughout the world.The digital revolution is requiring international organizations to radically rethink their approach. They have to integrate new technologies, automate existing processes, and develop innovative business models. With communication always as the focus. Communication with customers, employees, and business partners. The key to a company’s success is the reliable flow of information. Even today, billions and billions of information packages are transported from point A to point B. Daily. And the number continues to grow. It is essential that every last bit of information arrives at its destination. At the right time. In the right place. And in the right format. We call this information logistics.Email, fax, SMS, and EDI are the key channels for business communication. The exchange of information must not only rely on state-of-the-art technology, but it must also be able to continuously fulfill greater requirements in terms of security, compliance, and profitability. It takes a lot of experience to steer information flows at this level.

Women in tech are a smart lot, working as developers, analysts, programmers and everything in between. However, while some can code in a number of complex languages and have all the smarts in the world, many struggle with how to progress into leadership positions. And, quite frankly, this does not compute. 

Vic ICT for Women is the professional organisation that is putting a rocket up the industry and creating epic pathways for women in tech leadership.

WE ARE THE VOICE OF LEADERSHIP

- We are working the diversity agenda from the top down.
- We are mentoring, training and connecting our individual members. 
- We are inspiring women of all ages to enter, stay in and upskill in an amazing industry.
- We have pioneered award-winning and record-breaking programs that mean we’re rolling our sleeves up and getting seriously dirty about diversity in tech. 

We offer ground-breaking programs for tech careers from start to finish, to visit our website to see them all. 

GET INVOLVED

Now is the time to pull together, get real and create real change. Please share this with your sisters, mother, neighbours and daughters. Everyone is invited, not just those with a two X chromosome. Women played a massive role among the original tech pioneers, so let’s get behind diversity and create balance, fairness and visible career paths for everyone in tech.

WHAT WE DO.

Based in Sydney, ICT Networks is the best-kept secret of some of the biggest names in banking, internet service providers (ISPs), telecommunications and the public sector.

These organisations rely on us to design, implement, operate and manage their networks. We provide technical expertise to resolve issues, scale up resourcing, assist with complex projects and generally make everyone’s lives easier.
 

Some of our clients include: 
- Fox Sports Australia
- BPay
- NSW Government: Service First
- Sony Music
- Big Air
- Australian Rugby Union

SIZE DOES MATTER.

Our technical consulting team is small and agile – we aren’t mired in layers of management and can quickly respond to your business needs. Because we’re small, you can:
 
 Speak directly to the people who are doing the work for you.

Access the right people when you need them – including our engineers and administrative support staff.
Keep the same consultant – our low staff turnover means that over time we build a strong understanding of your business and its requirements.

Be assured of our autonomy – we are independently owned and managed, so we don’t have an agenda to push certain products.

LOCAL ENGINEERS WITH GLOBAL EXPERIENCE

We don’t just let any old engineers work at ICT Networks. Our engineer-selection process is tough:
 
Successful candidates must have Level Three certification in their areas of expertise. They must be business-minded.
