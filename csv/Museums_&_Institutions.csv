Perth Zoo,"20 Labouchere Rd, South Perth, WA 6151, AU","The role and purpose of zoos have changed enormously in recent decades. As a modern zoo, Perth Zoo aims to provide visitors with the opportunity to encounter the natural world and to become involved in conservation action.

Our vision, which inspires and directs our work, is for a world where diversity of species and habitats is secure.

Our purpose as an organisation is to actively contribute to conservation. This is done through our research activities, support for wildlife projects, our animal breeding programs particularly breeding animals for release into the wild, wildlife rehabilitation, and partnerships with other groups and organisations.

Newstead House,"Newstead Park 191a Breakfast Creek Road NEWSTEAD, Brisbane , Queensland  4006, AU","Discover another world...One of the most prominent homes in Queensland's history, this iconic landmark has been occupied by some of Brisbane's most influential colonial figures, including Patrick Leslie, Captain John Clements Wickham and George Harris.  Built in 1846 and Brisbane's oldest standing residence Newstead House is the jewel in the crown of South East Queensland's historic properties.  Now operating as a living museum, the grand home is furnished to reflect the occupation of the Harris family, who were in residence between 1862 and 1890.  Featuring wrap around generous verandas with sweeping views out to the Brisbane river, the home has had  a number of significant changes over the years.The core of Newstead House is the 1846 two storey brick and stone Georgian cottage built by Patrick Leslie, one of the pioneers of the Darling Downs.  From 1847 until early until early in 1860, Newstead was the home of Captain John Clements Wickham, the highest ranking official in Moreton Bay.  By 1859 Queensland was poised to become a colony in its own right, separate from New South Wales.  But Wickham was overlooked for the position of Governor and declined an opportunity to become Colonial Treasurer.   From 1862 Newstead House was owned by politician and merchant George Harris who created the Newstead  House we know today.  Working with prominent architect and politician James Cowlishaw, Harris made significant improvements and extensions.    The Harris family led a lavish lifestyle, with an entertainment budget said to have been up to 20, 000 pounds a year.   By 1874 George Harris had mortgaged the property to James Taylor of Toowoomba.

UNHCR statistics for 1975 to 1997 indicated that although 839,228 fleeing Vietnamese had arrived at refugee camps, between 200,000 to 400,000 had died at sea.It was an unforgettable catastrophe for the survivors.It was due to the generosity of the late Malcome Fraser and his immigration policies that permitted the first wave of 56 000 Vietnamese refugees into the country. Despite the language barriers and difference in culture and lifestyles, the first wave of Vietnamese refugees were committed to assimilating with their new community to teach and lead the way for future coming refugees.The museum will be built to honour the hardships experienced by Vietnamese refugees after the fall of Saigon in April 1975, and will preserve and display the historical artefacts collected from Vietnamese boat people during their journey to Australia.

St. John's Cemetery Project,"Parramatta, New South Wales 2150, AU","“The dead are soon forgotten…”So said an “Old Parramattan” in 1890 in reference to the people buried at Australia’s oldest surviving European cemetery: St. John’s Cemetery, Parramatta (1790). But the dead are not so easily forgotten if their stories live again!The St. John’s Cemetery Project is an online database for Australia’s oldest surviving European cemetery, which was established in January 1790 in an old stock paddock on the outskirts of Parramatta, the land of the Darug Nation’s Burramattagal clan. Thenceforth, it became the final resting place of Dicky Bennelong, the son of Woollarawarre Bennelong; more than 50 First Fleeters; a multitude of convicts, soldiers, pioneers and colonial elites who were immortalised in place names in Parramatta and surrounds; Governors’ wives, women and children who died at the Parramatta Female Factory; orphans who passed away at the Orphan Schools at Parramatta and Liverpool; as well as patients from the nearby convict hospitals and various mental health institutions in the colony — to highlight just a few major groups that are well represented in this historic cemetery.Originally a non-denominational cemetery, St. John’s is also a place of diversity that provides a more nuanced view of the early colony and the town of Parramatta specifically, with Aboriginal, Jewish, Chinese, Indian, Muslim, Romani, African American, German, Dutch, and French people buried here as well as British Anglicans. This State Heritage listed site, then, is significant not just for Parramatta, New South Wales, or even Australian history, but for World History.Our first feature collection, “St. John’s First Fleeters,” begins the process of bringing to life once more the stories of the people buried herein.

Our object mounts and exhibition furniture are tailored to meet rigorous Conservation and Registration standards required by leading cultural institutions.With two well-equipped workshops in the Canberra region we possess the capacity for high workflow and the ability to produce a broad scope of fabrication and installation works. We have a proven record for delivering complete museum services to Government clients on time and within budget. Some recent projects include the latest iteration of 'Play Up'​ at Museum of Australian Democracy (MoAD), a children’s space which won the MAGNA 2018 award in the ‘Permanent Exhibition or Gallery Fitout’ category. We were involved in most aspects of this major redevelopment, including interpretive development, technical design, and specialised fabrication.One such component is a trio of immersive sound capsules, which consist of internally illuminated floor to ceiling tubes  measuring 1m in diameter. Young visitors enter the intimate space and are gently transported into the realm of the audio content on the cosy cushioned floor. Another element is a series of bespoke showcases encapsulated in decorative powdercoated steel frames, which house key objects from the Museum of Democracy's significant heritage collection. Another challenging module to create was the puzzle piece interactive; an array of sixteen rotating 30x30cm triangular prism ""pixels""​ fabricated from urethane hard-coated extruded polystyrene. In this experience the visitor physically rotates the dynamic and colour matched tiles; a harmonious configuration yielding a complete thematic picture. The National Museum of Australia's exhibition 'Songlines: Tracking the Seven Sisters'​ recently won the MAGNA 2018 award in the category ‘Temporary or Travelling Exhibition’. Our team was involved in various aspects of this project. From creating a discrete modular armature for facilitating the process of sculpture  photogrammetry, which the multimedia team  utilised to render the characters in the very successful immersive interactive experience.  To installing all the artworks and objects, including unstretched canvases measuring over six metres in length. We worked closely with the conservation team to develop and fabricate custom engineer endorsed stainless steel mounts for the seven oversized flying Tjampi sculptures; these comprised a textured and colour matched exoskeleton suspension system, which created the illusion that the figures were actively ascending in the space up to six metres above the visitors.2018 Commonwealth Games medals display for the Royal Australian Mint.'Finders Keepers'​, MoAD’s current show, is the largest exhibition the Museum's history.

Museum of Australian Democracy at Eureka (MADE),"102 Stawell Street South, Ballarat, VIctoria 3350, AU","The Museum of Australian Democracy at Eureka (MADE) was an Australian museum, which engaged visitors in the compelling story of democracy. The stories were told of the ordinary men and women, past and present, which have fought for the democratic freedoms we enjoy today.  The Museum had a short life - less than five years between 2013 and 2018.Located on the historic site of the 1854 Eureka Stockade, MADE explored the powerful story of Eureka as a significant part of the struggle for peoples’ rights in Australia and around the world. MADE commemorated the pivotal role of the Stockade in shaping Australia’s democracy. MADE’s permanent exhibition used innovative digital immersion to engage visitors with the questions: What is democracy and why do we care? Why has it been fought for, yesterday and today? What does it feel like to be without power?Iconic historic objects were also on display including the Flag of the Southern Cross, exhibited for the first time since 1854 on this historic site.Through a series of exciting public programs and temporary exhibitions, visitors were inspired to explore diversity, creativity and the hidden stories of the past and present. As a centre of discussion on contemporary democracy, MADE was proud to host some of Australia’s most creative thinkers. In 2015, MADE was awarded a MAGNA Award for museum innovation.After less than five years of operation, the Museum's sole member, the City of Ballarat, voted to defund MADE in February 2018.  The Museum ceased trading on 31 March 2018, de-accessioned its collection, and the site was handed to Council to develop into a Eureka visitors'​ centre.",null,Museums and Institutions,11-50 employees,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Museum_of_Australian_Democracy_at_Eureka,"Ballarat, VIctoria",Nonprofit,2013,https://www.linkedin.com/company/museum-of-australian-democracy-at-eureka-made-/,"102 Stawell Street South, Ballarat, VIctoria, 3350, AU",-37.5609,143.85497,Ballarat,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,AU

Queensland Air Museum,"7 Pathfinder Drive, Caloundra, QLD 4551, AU","The Queensland Air Museum is a not-for-profit community owned aviation museum located at Caloundra Airport in Queensland, Australia. Its mission is to collect and preserve all aspects of aviation heritage with an emphasis on Australia and Queensland. The museum has the largest collection of historical aircraft in Queensland and it also has a large collection of aircraft engines, equipment, artefacts, photographs and books.

On 2 June 1974 the Queensland Air Museum was inaugurated with the official unveiling of a Canberra bomber that had been purchased from a Government disposal. The aircraft was displayed at the Pioneer Valley Park, which was a museum at Kuraby in Brisbane’s southern suburbs. The park was eventually closed and the aircraft was moved to a leased site at Nudgee on the north side of Brisbane. The collection began to grow when a Meteor TT20 was donated to the museum by the British Government and a Vampire and two Sea Venoms were acquired.

Due to the construction of the new Brisbane Airport nearby, the collection was forced to move to a temporary holding area on the airport site. Exorbitant rental costs at this location eventually lead to the museum being evicted and the resultant publicity resulted in an offer of a permanent home on the Sunshine Coast by the Landsborough Shire Council. On 14 June 1986 the collection was relocated to a site at Caloundra Airport which had a newly built hangar. The official opening of the museum took place on 4 April 1987 by Mrs Ly Bennett, wife of the museum’s first patron, the late Air Vice-Marshal Don Bennett. Don Bennett was the Queensland born founder of the World War II Bomber Command Pathfinder Force and to honour this the road in front of the museum was named Pathfinder Drive.",null,Museums and Institutions,11-50 employees,http://www.qam.com.au,"Caloundra, QLD",Nonprofit,1974,https://www.linkedin.com/company/queensland-air-museum/,"7 Pathfinder Drive, Caloundra, QLD, 4551, AU",-26.792177,153.09967,Caloundra,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,AU

KINGS Artist-Run,null,"Kings Artist Run is a non-profit artist-led gallery in Melbourne’s CBD that functions as a collective of artists, writers, curators and academics. Founded in 2003, Kings Artist Run was formed to explore, interpret and participate in the mediation of new social and cultural meanings. 

Kings Artist Run provides a location for contemporary art practice, supporting distinctive experimental projects by artists at all stages of their careers. Kings Artist Run assists and promotes the development of solo exhibitions, group and thematic projects, along with a program of events that includes performance, film screenings, public gatherings and talks.

The annual exhibition program at Kings Artist Run is formed around individual exhibition projects interspersed with thematic curatorial projects. Therefore each half-year of the exhibition and event program involves a thematic grouping of focused projects evoking and forming a discourse around specific subjects, supported by allied events and talks. Notably, Kings Artist Run equally supports artists wishing to undertake single or individual projects unrelated to our programming themes, locating these individual exhibition projects within a gallery culture involving focused curatorial undertakings that form a platform for initiating new ideas as a way of developing critical social relations.

Kings Artist Run is an entirely non-profit and altruistic collective seeking to provide a foundation for artists, while receiving support through programming fees, individual donations and sponsorships, along with periodic assistance from local, State and National arts funding bodies. Kings Artist Run receives support through the artists that show at Kings, the studio artists and writers, the community that supports us, and most generously through our volunteers.",null,Museums and Institutions,2-10 employees,http://www.kingsartistrun.com.au,"Melbourne, Victoria",Nonprofit,2003,https://www.linkedin.com/company/kings-artist-run/,"5 Blackwood St, North Melbourne VIC 3051, Australia",-37.8015361,144.9544919,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null
