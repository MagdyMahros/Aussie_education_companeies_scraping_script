Which is fortunate because designing great solutions for our clients can foster quite the appetite!As a client, you can expect a level of attention that will allow you to feel like your requests are not only listened to, but carefully considered with your end target in mind. No request is too small. On the other hand if it's too big then we'll let you know that it's possibly out of our scope or that we'll need to engage some other creative professionals to help us all achieve the desired outcome.Our clients engage us to create campaigns and collateral that require adept knowledge of loads of different software applications. From logo design to keeping your brand on-point; website design to online marketing campaigns; print design including everything from business cards to annual reports; signage and large format displays to exhibition stands and even custom illustrations and animated presentations.Just because we're good at what we do, doesn't mean we don't get involved in the things that make this wonderful city of Melbourne so appealing to so many. Sport is synonymous with our little town, and it's no different inside the walls of Evil Olive. Essendon v Carlton, Chelsea v Tottenham, Supercoach talk, the great/terrible golf scores that were shot over the weekend, gym, tennis and every other pursuit that we love makes us another cog in the big wheel of the Melbourne sporting scene.When it comes to client meetings, we'll happily go out for lunch and sit in the sun.

Brands are our business. Building awareness with commercial success is the objective of every project we undertake. 

Brands are cultural. Brands communicate the organisations strategy and personality. They are more than a logo, a typeface, a colour or an image. Branding is the emotional connection between a company, its product or service, and the customer they wish to engage. Positioning the product or service front of mind when the consumer is ready to act, is essential to a successful business. Branding does this through the value of an idea which an organisation invests in and communicates through a diverse range of media.

The approach Hexagon takes with each new challenge is bespoke. Each strategy is customised to achieve the key objectives outlined in the brief. We often create our very own typefaces, this provides the brand with a sense ?of ownership over the messages they portray and therefore a distinctive personality. Graphics and imagery either photographic or illustrative are conceived, art directed and then created to help express a distinctive language, clearly defining the brand voice and its Identity.",null,null,0-1 employees,http://www.hexagondesign.com.au,"Melbourne Area, Victoria",Privately Held,null,https://www.linkedin.com/company/hexagon-design-p-l/,"PO Box 603 Emerald, Melbourne Area, Victoria, 3782, AU",-37.879314,145.50948,Melbourne Area,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,AU

We do it by working hard to understand what our clients need to say. And saying it in the most effective way is what we really do best.

Pink Piranha - Design with a bite,null,"Penny Askin heads Pink Piranha, an innovative graphic design company, centrally located in Osborne Park.

Pink Piranha helps new or established small to medium businesses to make their mark by creating or updating how they present themselves in the marketplace.

Services include logo development, business stationery and promotional material such as flyers, posters, brochures, layout for catalogues,full colour magazines and signage. The company also designs press advertisements and contributes to marketing campaigns.

At Pink Piranha we develop a close working relationship with our clients. We work on small, one-off projects or contribute to more involved campaigns.

Pink Piranha manage to keep their overheads down which means services are generally more affordable for small businesses, especially those who are dipping their toe in the water for the first time.
 
Many small businesses often overlook the need to budget adequately for the marketing of their business, says Penny.  
 
If people dont know about you, how can you expect them to respond to your offer?
 
Penny also appreciates that small business people are very busy. They dont have the luxury of a marketing manager to organise their promotional material or position their brand. They generally need help with a logo, business stationery, promotional material and usually their first brochure or catalogue. 
 
Penny believes that most people recognise that design is not their area of expertise but they usually know good design when they see it. 
 
And thats what we offer people. Great design, genuine empathy and a professional, affordable service.
