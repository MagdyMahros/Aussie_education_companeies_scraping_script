DEXA assesses bone mineral density and the body's soft tissue composition (muscle and fat mass) with 99% accuracy. Using these measurements we can determine your total body fat percentage, changes in regional body composition and even determine your risk of Type 2 Diabetes and heart disease. We also use the results from the DEXA to estimate your resting metabolic rate, which takes the guess work out of losing or gaining weight! Our staff are accredited exercise physiologists dedicated to delivering individual health assessments and customised advice.

Humming Puppy,null,"With studios in New York, Melbourne & Sydney, Humming Puppy is a yoga experience evolved from traditional practices in a stunning space that resonates with a perfect hum. More than just the physical practice of yoga, your experience begins the moment you sign up and book your mat online. Enter the studio, leave the outside world behind and immerse yourself in good vibes.We don't prescribe to any specific style of yoga but rather draw our inspiration from all of the lineages from which our teachers have practiced and learnt. We believe this gives our students a unified and holistic practice. We base our teachings on the principles of breath-pranayama, movement-asana and awareness-meditation.When taking a class at Humming Puppy, one of the first things you will notice is that the room quite literally 'hums'​... and this is by no means an accident! Our yoga space or ‘shala’, is injected with a combination of frequencies to enhance and deepen your experience. More specifically we use a combination of 7.83hz and 40hz. Being submersed in these frequencies helps you to naturally produce matching frequencies through a process of entrainment. 7.83hz otherwise known as the Schumann Resonance is actually the frequency of the earth itself and helps to 'ground'​ you through your practice. 40hz is specifically associated with ‘Gamma’ brainwave activity, integral for achieving states of peak performance. Elite athletes, top-notch musicians and high achievers in all fields, typically produce far more gamma waves than average. And whilst all of that sounds quite serious and complicated, on a much simpler level the hum just feels good!",null,null,11-50 employees,http://www.hummingpuppy.com,"Prahran, VIC",Privately Held,null,https://www.linkedin.com/company/hummingpuppy/,"Levels 1 & 2, 146 Abercrombie St, Redfern, NSW, 2016, AU",-33.84907,151.13834,Redfern,null,"2/22 Cecil Place, Prahran, VIC, 3181, AU",-37.803425,145.01105,Prahran,null,"119 W 23rd St, New York, null, null, US",40.860245,-93.26005,New York,"Suite 200, Level 2",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,US

NUNKUWARRIN YUNTI OF SA INC,"182-190 Wakefield St, Adelaide, SA 5000, AU","Nunkuwarrin Yunti of South Australia was initiated in the 1960s by the late Mrs Gladys Elphick, who founded the Council of Aboriginal Women of SA, one of the first Aboriginal organisations in South Australia.

First incorporated in 1971, Nunkuwarrin Yunti has evolved from the Aboriginal Cultural Centre, the Aboriginal Community Centre of South Australia, and the Aboriginal Community Recreation and Health Services Centre of South Australia.

Our first health programme was established with the aid of donations, a small amount of government funding and the services of an empathetic and dedicated doctor.

We became known as Nunkuwarrin Yunti of South Australia Inc. in 1994, and in 1998 were named NAIDOC Organisation of the Year in South Australia.

The organisation is community controlled - governed by an all Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Board.

'Community control'​ underpins the delivery of culturally appropriate services to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.

Nunkuwarrin Yunti has grown from a welfare agency with three employees to a multi-faceted organisation with over 100 staff who delivers a diverse range of health care and community support services and is a registered training organisation.
Our name was adopted from the dialects of the two largest clans in the southern region - Ngarrindjeri and Narungga to represent the community, the services and the spirit in which they are provided.

Nunkuwarrin Yunti means 'Working Together – Doing Right Together'​ and proclaims our belief of one community sharing a united vision for the future.

This simple belief has seen Nunkuwarrin Yunti at the forefront of initiatives to improve the health, life expectancy and lifestyle prospects for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.

Vida Glow,"33 Maddox St, Unit 13, Alexandria, New South Wales 2015, AU","Vida Glow is a beauty and wellness ingestible & cosmetic brand. Inspired by nature and backed by science using pure potent ingredients.At Vida Glow we believe the importance of holistic wellness that goes beyond a one dimensional approach to beauty. True health begins within and the nutrients our bodies need can be obtained through the goodness of real food. The ingredients work in synergy and are carefully chosen for a reason: recognised and absorbed by the body for optimal results.From this philosophy the Vida Glow range grew from marine collagen supplements to include plant-based beauty and protein powders as well as on-the-go, nutrient dense collagen water and beauty bars and a full topical skincare range. We take pride knowing we are offering premium, quality products that really can make a difference.New product development is an area of extreme interest to Vida Glow with a goal to educate our customers on how to target their different needs and concerns. We take pride knowing we are offering premium, quality products that really can make a difference.VIda Glow is a global brand shipping to over 100 countries worldwide and are stocked within premium department stores, health and fitness stores, online beauty, pharmacies and spa/salons.BACKGROUND:Vida Glow was founded in 2014 by three health conscious Australians; Simon Hill and Kieran & Anna Lahey. Anna discovered marine collagen whilst on holidays in Japan, she was intrigued at how readily available ingestible collagen supplements were in Japan and how highly Japanese women spoke of its benefits.After observing the amazing skin quality of Japanese women, and feeling as though her own hair, skin and nails were in need of some TLC, Anna decided to purchase ingestible collagen for her personal use. With incredible visible results in a matter of weeks, Anna further researched collagen and its affect. Her research on its benefits for the human body were compelling and together the trio created Vida Glow with its initial focus solely on marine collagen supplements.Inspired by the overwhleming positive feedback that this ingestible supplement had on their customers worldwide, Simon, Kieran and Anna felt motivated to offer a more holistic approach to beauty and wellness. One that highlights that real health begins within, and that the nutrients that our bodies need can be obtained through the goodness of real food. From this philosophy the Vida Glow range grew to include plant-based beauty and protein powders as well as ready to drink, nutrient dense waters. New product development is an area of extreme interest to the founders, with a goal of executing functional blends that services their varied demographic of customers. Targeting different needs and concerns, products that are of exceptional quality and that have proven to work.  Moving into the topical skincare realm was a natural extension to the Vida Glow brand. One that encompasses a complete focus of health and beauty, from the inside and out. Ensuring product quality and providing the purest ingredients are imperative to the team, and no short cuts have been taken. Where possible Vida Glow's ingredients are certified organic and are all free from gluten, dairy, allergens, artificial colours and flavours, preservatives, parabens, silicones and never tested on animals.

Danger Sun Overhead,"300 South Pine Rd, Block D, Brendale, Queensland 4500, AU","Danger Sun Overhead (DSO) is an education program for outdoor industries, corporate work places, schools and sporting clubs, to promote the prevention, awareness, early detection and support of skin cancers, including melanoma. Danger Sun Overhead was founded when, Joanne Crotty lost her husband, Rohan Crotty, to melanoma in July 2009 at the age of 43, leaving her to raise their 4 boys under the age of five. Jo wants to share her story because most melanomas can be prevented if people have access to education and awareness about skin cancer.Rohan was constantly exposed to the sun as part of his work. After his first diagnosis in 2006, at the time an organiser with the CFMEU, he recognised sun safety standards were not being addressed in the outdoor industries. Rohan became associated with the University of Queensland to help UQ research skin cancer in the construction industry. This study brought the awareness to the hazards of sun exposure into the construction industry.After Jo was compensated for Rohan’s loss, due to his workplace not addressing the dangers of sun exposure, Jo founded DSO who now continue with this important work on Rohan’s behalf through the establishment of the Danger Sun Overhead program.Since the formation of Danger Sun Overhead in 2009, the Sun Safety initiative has provided education to over 50,000 workshop attendees in workplaces across Australia. Danger Sun Overhead’s services continue to be in high demand, delivering education workshops in all Australian states and territories.DSO have implemented our vision of educating apprentices in outdoor industries. Taking the DSO program to the apprentices of all outdoor industries enables us to capture the 15-39-year-old age group, which unfortunately, is the demographic group where melanoma is the most common cancer.

Offering altitude training enhances the member experience, accelerates training outcomes for individuals, and creates new revenue streams for owners. In addition, stylish 'altitude bedrooms'​ and apartments have been constructed and seamlessly retrofitted in to private residences for individuals looking to get an extra 'edge'​ in all aspects of life. The health benefits of training and/or sleeping  in 'hypoxic'​ (oxygen depleted) environments are now well-documented, but historically these environments have been cost prohibitive to create, and therefore not accessible to the mainstream (only elite athletes).

All women volunteer their time and expertise and are unified by a common understanding that the current state of women’s health needs addressing.We live in a world where roles and societal expectations dictate largely the perceived worth of a woman. The expectation to be a good mother, daughter, worker or student, lead a successful career, look a certain way, acquire the perfect body, to multi-task, to keep up in the corporate world while juggling family life and so on has meant women have lost sight of the inner-most connection to who they truly are and consequently, have found themselves defined by these roles. At the heart of Esoteric Women’s Health is the knowing that every woman, regardless of age, background, culture, religion or what she has achieved in life, holds an innate quality that is equal in all. It is from this inner quality that she can know herself as worthwhile and from the presence of this quality that we as a society benefit in many essential ways. Esoteric Women's Health holds two foundational understandings when it comes to instigating this necessary change, ensuring it is true and sustainable. ​– That within each and every woman lies the answers to the restoration of her own innate value– That lifestyle choices are key to understanding our state of health and wellbeingThe ability to honour the true beauty and worth that lies within every women and to know that it is from this foundation that supportive lifestyle choices are made and sustained, allows the restoration of a level of health and vitality many have forgotten is even possible.

Nature Play WA Inc is an incorporated not-for-profit association established to increase the time Western Australian children spend in unstructured play outdoors and in nature. It is founded on the understanding that unstructured play outdoors (nature play) is fundamental to a full and healthy childhood.

Nature play is, of itself, an intrinsic good and from it flow benefits in health, cognitive, social and emotional development and in the building of resilience and creativity. Experience in nature as a child also leads to environmental stewardship later in life.

Nature Play WA is a collaborative organisation working with partner groups to encourage the WA community to value nature play and families to prioritise it in children’s lives. The organisation's primary role is to spread the nature play message and to work to increase access to nature play resources, events and programs.

Nature Play WA began as an initiative of the Western Australian Department of Sport and Recreation and was inspired by the ideas of American social commentator Richard Louv and the Children and Nature Network.",null,null,2-10 employees,http://www.natureplaywa.org.au,"Perth, WA",Nonprofit,null,https://www.linkedin.com/company/nature-play-wa/,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null

We are a group of surfers and snowboarders. Our passion is outdoor sports and we try to enjoy nature as much as possible. If you stay in the outdoors under blue skies and the bright sun for too long, you will face the sun's harming effects on your skin. The problem is: we only have one skin and our skin never forgets - so we have to protect it. 

Traditional sunscreens were never designed for the extreme conditions you experience while surfing the ocean or snowboarding the mountains. Most sun protection products don't absorb properly and might run into your eyes, leaving you with stinging eyes and damaged skin. This can lead to sunburns, premature skin aging, or even more serious diseases like skin cancer or macula degeneration. So we at SWOX got together to create the best possible sun protection products, which fit our needs. And because we know that there is no substitute for expertise and experience, our products are developed in conjunction with both medical researchers from Germany, Switzerland and Australia as well as professional athletes all over the globe.

Thrive With EFT,"183 Oxford Street, Bondi Junction NSW 2022, Suite 103/First Floor, Bondi Junction, NSW 2022, AU","We provide mindset change programs  for high performers. If you are driven, ambitious, talented, intelligent, passionate and most of all are clear on where you want to be but feel blocked at times, then we are the right match! You could be excelling in academia, sports, performing arts, career...  Are you content with how you are going? Are you hungry to go that step further, but somehow are stuck? Do you find yourself thinking, no matter how hard you strive, it is not enough? The story of high performers is that although they may be receiving accolades, recognitions and reward for their achievements, there comes a time when they 'feel'​ stuck. The journey to consistent performance is not always plain sailing. In fact the higher you climb, the harder not only making progress, but maintaining progress, can be. We see this in movies and in real life with high performing athletes and wonder why do these champions find their upward trajectories all of a sudden flattening into a a plateau? According to research conducted by Harvard Business Review ""high achievers often let anxiety about their performance compromise their progress.""​  To aggravate the situation further, they also are at the forefront of criticisms from society quite often.  Being a high performer  comes with its own challenges, expectations, not just for yourself, but others that believe in them too.  In my own personal journey, I have experienced waves of success as well living in shadows of self-doubt. My life long pattern was to continuously strive and drain my energy in doing so. In accomplishing my goals, I sacrificed my health, mental well being and peace in my relationships. My underlying belief was that success comes at a cost. What I have learned is that it does not have to be like that. Now I choose thrive, instead of strive. This is how Thrive With EFT was born.  I have found EFT (Emotional Freedom Technique, aka tapping) a powerful and effective technique that has enabled me to release that compounding stress that I place on myself. EFT is a great enabler in removing the noise we often get blocked, be that noise, a nagging voice inside saying 'you are not good enough'​, or something you have heard from society. EFT helps release negative conditioning, limitations and blocks.   EFT works and its benefits are felt quite rapidly.

The supplements industry is overcrowded with options for all different types of lifestyles. How do you even begin to consider which one is right for you, let alone who to trust. The truth is, it's difficult. But like many other consumables, the key is right there on the packet - the nutritional panel and ingredients list. 

Here at PSA, we are very passionate about health and fight for the awareness of what consumers are putting into their bodies. We endeavour to be a source of knowledge for our products and work heavily towards being transparent with our ingredients & processes. 

We're not perfect, but with a narrow focus, constant learning, agile processes, and creative thinking we can continually improve the solutions and insights we share. If we do this well, we will help improve ourselves and the lives of those around us. 

Think Clean.
Eat Natural.
Live Healthy.

The range uses a synergistic blend of both active and efficacious ingredients, supported by science, to ensure that your skin is cared for from the inside, out.“I believe that beauty is an inside-out process. Glowing skin is basically a reflection of healthy cells and the solution to a clearer, more radiant complexion and general wellbeing occurs when you balance your gut and feed your body nutrient-dense food.

Our first film launched in 2008, and four films, one podcast, countless guided programs, an annual magazine, and one online streaming network later, our mission remains the same. The Food Matters community is unlike any other. Our audience spans over 3 million people worldwide, who come together to share new ideas, lift each other up, and look after themselves holistically. It’s our community that inspires us to dive deeper into our understanding of nutrition, the way we perceive health, and how we can use tools like meditation and yoga to transcend the bounds of reality.About UsIn 2003, James’ father was diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome. We saw firsthand how the modern medical profession was failing him, with a cocktail of medications to address the fatigue and all of the cascading side effects. But like anyone, he put his faith in the professionals prescribing his pills, and grew more disheartened as time went on and nothing changed. Or if it did, it got worse. We knew there had to be a better way to get through to him. So we hit the books and soon discovered we could heal our health with nutrition. It was here that our journey into Food Matters began.FOOD MATTERS is based on Queensland's Sunshine Coast meters from white sandy beaches and healthy cafe's.

McKenzie Institute Australia,"PO Box 7345, Beaumaris, Melbourne, Vic 3193, AU","Developed by Robin McKenzie, The McKenzie Method of Mechanical Diagnosis and Therapy (MDT) is a comprehensive ASSESSMENT, CLASSIFICATION and MANAGEMENT system for people with musculoskeletal problems. The Method is patient focused, evidence based and one of the most rigorously researched approaches in musculoskeletal medicine.

MDT allows patients to be classified into subgroups which assists with differential diagnosis and identifying contraindications to physical therapy. This rapidly identifies patients suitable for exercise or manual therapy and those who aren't; saving time and money for the clinician and patient.

Patient management is based on taking a comprehensive history and interpreting the symptomatic and mechanical response to repeated movements and positions. Management incorporates the latest pain science through personalized EDUCATION and where appropriate, MOVEMENT BASED interventions to enable the patient to SELF MANAGE. Some patients may also require short term 'hands on' therapy and MDT can identify when this is appropriate. 

MDT is taught through a validated and internationally standardised education program. It consists of:

Part A - The Lumbar Spine (28 hours)
Part B - The Cervical & Thoracic Spine (28 hours)
Part C - Advanced Lumbar Spine and Extremities (Lower Limb) (28 hours)
Part D - Advanced Cervical & Thoracic Spine and Extremities (Upper Limb) (28 hours)

The studio was the first of its kind, solely teaching Vinyasa yoga – a style developed from its Hatha Vinyasa roots.Neutral Bay quickly became one of the busiest studios in Australia and alongside it grew an inspiring community that continues to flourish today. In 2006, long-time friend of Duncan’s and devoted yoga practitioner Keenan Crisp joined the team. Together with others from the tribe they created Power Living and the studios you see today.Power Living yoga is a modern-day physical and philosophical practice that focuses on developing a person’s spiritual wellbeing as much as their physical and mental health. It embraces all traditions and teachings with respect. There’s nothing mystical, unattainable or complex. Its aim is to provide a simple yet holistic practice that creates a greater connection to everyday life.As practitioners, we focus on evolving our bodies and minds as well as a deeper connection to our spiritual sides. We also develop a personal philosophy that helps us deal with the ups and downs of life.

SuperFeast,"20 Brigantine St, Byron Bay, New South Wales 2481, AU","We really love tonic herbs and medicinal mushrooms. We take them every day. We think they’re awesome. We fell in love with them, they transformed us and we decided we needed to share them with the world. We only want to work with the best herbs. The herbs that are potent, rooted in history and lore, grown with their feet in the soil and the sun on their faces. We want our mushrooms to experience their potential as the connectors and unifiers of the forest before we ingest them, so we can take on those qualities too. You are what you eat.We want our herbs to push up through rocky soil and to compete, to fight to survive, to grow strong. We want to take on those qualities, too. We want to support industries that have been operating for thousands of years, cultivating and ingesting these herbs. We believe in nature. We believe she provides the best feast. We believe we all have the potential to be a little bit superhuman.We only sell what we take. It’s all the same. What we give to our families. And our friends. And to you. Just wild or wild-crafted herbs, extracted consciously, packed with love and delivered to your fave health food store or doorstep ;)The Practical StuffWe sell powdered extracts of tonic herbs and medicinal mushrooms (which are technically tonic herbs but this seems to confuse everyone, so we’ll keep ‘em separated for clarity). What is a ‘powdered extract,’ you ask? Great question. A powdered extract is basically the end result of taking a bunch of herbs and boiling and/or tincturing them for a while. The powder comes about after the resultant extract is dried and pushed through an ultra-fine sieve. Our extracts are 10:1, which means it takes 10kgs of herb to make 1kg of our extracts.",1300769500,null,11-50 employees,http://www.superfeast.com.au,"Byron Bay, New South Wales",Privately Held,null,https://www.linkedin.com/company/superfeast/,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null
